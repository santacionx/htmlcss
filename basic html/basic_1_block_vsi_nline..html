    <p>Block-level elements are those that generate a line break before and after the element, and take up the full available width of their parent container by default. Examples of block-level elements include headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), divs, and lists (ul, ol).
        <br><br>
        Inline-level elements, on the other hand, do not generate a line break before or after the element, and only take up as much width as necessary to contain their content. Examples of inline-level elements include spans, images, links (a), and emphasized text (em).
        <br><br>
        The display behavior of an element can be changed using CSS properties such as display, which can be set to "block" to make an inline-level element behave like a block-level element, or "inline" to make a block-level element behave like an inline-level element.
        <br><br>
        Some additional differences between block-level and inline-level elements include:
        <br>
        - Block-level elements can contain other block-level and inline-level elements, while inline-level elements can only contain inline-level elements and text nodes.
        - Block-level elements can have margin, padding, and border applied to them on all sides, while inline-level elements only allow margin and padding to be applied horizontally (left and right).
        - Block-level elements are typically used to create structural elements on a web page, while inline-level elements are used for content that is meant to be part of a larger block of text.
        Overall, understanding the differences between block-level and inline-level elements is important for creating and styling web page content.</p>
