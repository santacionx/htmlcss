     <p>Semantic tags are HTML tags that provide meaning and structure to the content of a webpage. 
        
        They help search engines and other software to understand the context of the content on a webpage, making it easier for them to index, classify, and retrieve the information.
        <br> <br>
        Semantic tags include elements such as 
        <br> <br>
        header, footer, nav, main, section, article, aside, figure, figcaption, time, mark, and others.
        
        These tags help to define the structure and hierarchy of a webpage and provide additional context to assistive technologies like screen readers.
        <br><br>
        Using semantic tags can improve the accessibility, usability, and search engine optimization (SEO) of a webpage, making it more user-friendly and easier to find online.</p>

            A sidebar is a section of a web page that is typically located to the left or right of the main content area. It is often used to display secondary information or navigation that is related to the main content of the page.
