        <h1>Five tips for front end developer</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Front-end development : &nbsp; refers to the part of web development that focuses on the user interface (UI)
            and user experience (UX) of a website or web application. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            to create interactive and responsive websites that can be viewed on a variety of devices, including
            desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Front-end developers work closely with designers to turn design concepts into working code, and with back-end
            developers to integrate the front-end with the server-side infrastructure. They are responsible for ensuring
            that the website is visually appealing, easy to use, and performs well on different browsers and devices.
        <p> Some common tasks performed by front-end developers include designing and coding layouts, creating
            animations and interactive features, optimizing the website for performance, and testing the website to
            ensure it works as expected.</p>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Stay updated with the latest technologies and trends: Front-end development is a constantly evolving
                    field, so it's important to stay on top of the latest trends and technologies. Keep learning new
                    skills, attending webinars and conferences, and following industry leaders and experts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Optimize for performance: Ensure that your website is optimized for performance by minimizing file
                    sizes, using caching techniques, and leveraging CDNs. This will help improve the user experience and
                    ensure that your website loads quickly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Write clean and modular code: Writing clean and modular code is essential to creating scalable and
                    maintainable web applications. Use consistent naming conventions, comments, and indentation to make
                    your code readable and understandable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Test, test, test: Testing is an important part of the development process, so make sure you test your
                    website thoroughly on different devices and browsers. Use automated testing tools like Selenium and
                    Jest to catch bugs early and save time in the long run.</p>

                <p>Collaborate with others: Front-end development often involves working with designers, back-end
                    developers, and other stakeholders. Collaborate with them to ensure that everyone is on the same
                    page, and communicate clearly and regularly to ensure that the project runs smoothly.</p>
